# Automated-Code-Security-Auditing-with-AI-Powered-Reporting
This project performs an automated security audit on a Python codebase using tools like Bandit, Semgrep, pip-audit, Gitleaks, TruffleHog, and more. It scans for vulnerabilities, secrets, and dependency issues, then uses Gemini AI to generate a detailed security report with findings and remediation advice.
